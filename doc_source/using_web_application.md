To get started with the Amazon WorkMail web application, you need a broadband internet connection and the latest version of one of the following web browsers:
+ Google Chrome

+ Internet Explorer

Your Amazon WorkMail system administrator provides you with your initial login credentials, which consist of a user name and a password\. To recover a lost or forgotten password, contact your administrator\.

You also need your unique Amazon WorkMail web application URL\. This URL contains an alias, a unique name for your mail domain which is chosen by your Amazon WorkMail site administrator when they add your organization\. The web application URL looks like this: https://*alias*\.awsapps\.com/mail\.

**4\. **Contents Pane****  
This is where data displays, such as the contents of an email message, the calendar, or the list of contacts\.

Choose the plus button \(**\+**\) in the row of tabs to add a new item on its own tab\. The item created depends on the active application\. For example, choosing the plus button in the mail application creates a new email; in the calendar application, it creates a new appointment, and so on\.
