Amazon WorkMail has a web\-based application that you can use to access your Amazon WorkMail account from a web browser\.

To get started with the Amazon WorkMail web application, you need a broadband internet connection and the latest version of one of the following web browsers:

Your Amazon WorkMail system administrator provides you with your initial login credentials, which consist of a username and a password\. You also need your unique Amazon WorkMail web application URL, which contains an alias—the unique name chosen for your mail domain when your organization was added\.

The **Web application** URL is in the **General settings** tab and looks like this: https://*alias*\.awsapps\.com/mail\.

1. **Navigation Pane**—Allows you to navigate within the active application, such as the folders in the email application or the calendars within the calendar application\.

1. **Menu Bar**—Controls the most important functions for the Mail, Calendar, and Contacts applications\. The controls that are available vary depending on the application that is active\. Depending on the application in use, you can create new items, change the view, print, or access the address book\.

1. **Contents Pane**—Where data is displayed, such as the contents of an email message, the calendar, or the contacts list\. You can use the **Search** field at the top of the results pane to search for items in the current folder\. You can use the tabs to switch between email messages, appointments, and contacts\. You can choose the plus button \(\+\) in the row of tabs to add a new item in its own tab\. The item created depends on the active application\. For example, choosing the plus button in the mail application creates a new email; in the calendar application, it creates a new appointment, and so on\.
