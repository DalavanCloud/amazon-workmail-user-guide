# Working with Delegates<a name="delegates_overview"></a>

You can specify another user as a delegate who can send email on your behalf\. For example, if your coworker grants the appropriate permissions to you, you can send emails and schedule meetings on their behalf\. In this case, an email or meeting request is sent with the following in the **From** field: `you` on behalf of `coworker`\.

You can specify delegates in Microsoft Outlook\. To do this, connect to your Outlook account, and then choose **File**, **Account Settings**, and **Delegate Access**\.
