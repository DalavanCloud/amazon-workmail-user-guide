# Send as an Alias<a name="send_alias"></a>

You can send and receive email using an alias configured for you\. Recipients outside of your organization will then see the sender as your alias address instead of your primary address\. For information about configuring aliases, see [Edit User Email Addresses](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/edit_user_email_addresses.html)\.

**Note**  
If you send an email from an alias to someone in your organization, the message is still received from your primary address\. 

**To send an email from an alias**

1. In the Amazon WorkMail web application, choose the mail icon on the shortcut bar and choose **\+ New item**, **New email**\.

1. For **From**, type the alias from which to send email\.
**Tip**  
To include a display name, use the SMTP standard format “Your Name <youralias@domain\.com>”\.

1. When you're ready to send the email, choose **Send**\.
