## Email Tab<a name="email_tab"></a>

Changing the view from the mail application using the **View** menu updates this **Display preview pane** setting\.

****Close email when responding****  
When this setting is off, if you open an email in a new tab, a new tab is opened next to the existing one when you reply to the email\.

After you have created one or more signatures, you can \(optionally\) specify which one to use for new messages and which one to use for replies and forwards\.

## Email Rules Tab<a name="email_filters_tab"></a>

You can create email rules that help you focus on important emails and keep your inbox tidy\. Rules are stored on the server so that they can filter the mail before it arrives in your inbox\.

You can create as many rules as you want and with each rule, you can set various conditions to trigger the rule\. You can also set various follow\-up actions after the rule has been triggered\.

You can construct complex rules to deal with large email volumes or complex work flows\.

To create a new mail rule, choose **New**, and then in the **New email rule** dialog box, define the rule\.

You can set various conditions and actions that Amazon WorkMail performs on every message that meets the criteria you define\.

## Automatic Response Tab<a name="automatic_response_tab"></a>

The Amazon WorkMail web application lets you mark yourself “in” or “out” of the office\. Specify the message that is sent automatically in reply to all incoming messages while you are away\.

To prevent someone who is sending you several emails per day from getting a reply on each message, automatic responses are only sent one time to any specific email address\. This also prevents a mail flood in case the person who sends you the email also has automatic responses turned on\.

When **Automatic response** is enabled, and you log to the Amazon WorkMail web application, a warning message is shown to remind you that the **Automatic response** is set\. The warming message prompts you to turn it off\.

## Calendar Tab<a name="calendar_tab"></a>

****First day of the week****  
If your week starts on another day than Monday, you can set it to any other day using this setting\. The calendar then always starts with this day\.

****First week of the year****  
Specify how the calendar should begin the year\.

****Start of workday/End of workday****  
Specify the part of the day that is marked as “workday\.” The calendar shows this time period in a slightly different color so you can easily see when an appointment or meeting is scheduled outside office hours\. The default values for office hours are 8:30 \- 17:30 \(8:30 AM \- 5:30 PM\)\.

****Calendar resolution****  
If your appointments frequently start at other times than each half or entire hour, or have a duration other than \(multiples of\) 30 minutes, then you can change this value to better fit your needs\.  
Setting the value to less than 30 minutes makes the Amazon WorkMail web application zoom in on the calendar, so you scroll more when you are using a smaller screen\.

****View multiple calendars****  
Specify how multiple calendars should be displayed by default in the Calendar\. **Side\-by\-side** displays all calendars next to each other\. **Overlay** displays all calendars transparently on top of each other, where each calendar has its own color\.  
This setting has no effect when you are only displaying one calendar\.

****Default reminder time****  
Specify how long before the start of the appointment the default reminder should occur\. This setting can be overruled for any appointment by editing it manually in the calendar\. The default is 15 minutes\.

****Default all\-day appointment reminder time****  
Specify the reminder time that is automatically set when you create a new all\-day appointment\. The default is 18 hours\. This setting can be overruled for any appointment by editing it manually in the calendar\.
